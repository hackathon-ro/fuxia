Project Description:
====================
  The Distributed Sudoku Generator Project generates Sudoku games which have different levels of difficulty. Traditionaly
the Sudoku games are divided into five categories, according to human perceived difficulty. We have decided to keep the
same five levels in our implementation of the generator:

  - extremely easy
  - easy
  - medium
  - difficult
  - evil

_"Generating Sudoku puzzles is easy. Generating evil Sudoku puzzles is... EVIL."_

Four factors affecting the difficulty level are taken into consideration in this metrics
respectively as follows:
  - the total amount of given cells,
  - the lower bound of given cells in each row and column,
  - applicable techniques by human logic thinking, and
  - enumerating search times by computer.

Solution's Building Blocks
--------------------------
There are three fundamental entities used in our implementation:
 - __Solver__
    - _input_: an incomplete Sudoku board
    - _output_:
      - None: there is no solution for solving the board
      - solution: if there exists at least one posssible solution, it returns the completed Sudoku board
    - _explanation_:
      - simple baktracking using few optimizations. At each step: we compute all the possible values for each cell,
        select the cell with the fewest possibilites and then expand it.
 - __Las Vegas__
    - _output_: a complete Sudoku board
    - _explanation_:
        - this is a well known algorithm for generating Sudoku boards.
        - we generate a few random cells and then use the __Solver__ to find a possible solution.
 - __Digger__:
    - _input_: a complete Sudoku board (generated by __Las Vegas__)
    - _output_: incomplete Sudoku board with a unique solution (the starting board for the human player)
    - _explanation_:
        - we try "digging out" cells such that the remaining board has only one solution.
        - the way we implement the "dig out" operations determines the difficulty of the game.
